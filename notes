Battle:
    - Minigame where button sequences must be pressed in order to deal
    damage?
    - Generic RPG battle?
    - Rock/Paper/Scissors style combat?
    - Perhaps a RPG style battle where standard attacks do tiny amounts
    of damage unless a successful block renders the enemy open to attack.
    It would be turn based, so a block/attack would take a turn. Attack
    does 1x damage, attack while enemy is open is 3x.
    - Perhaps taking some inspiration from Warioware games, battle
    works by having timed events that require a button press/mash
    at specific times. A successful press/mash would attack or block or
    some random battle specific event.

BATTLE!:
    - Battle occurs in phases:
        - Player attack phase
        - Player defend phase
        - Player recovery phase
    - Player starts at level 1, and can go up to 100.
    - Level up required exp is equation ceil(current_level + 4 * 1.7) ?
    May tweak later...
    - In attack phase, if the player's level = X, then there are X
    possible sequences that the player may be prompted to input.
    The number of successfully input sequences indicates attack level.
    All sequences must be input within (ln(1.5 + X) * 2.5) seconds.
    Every sequence randomly has 3 or 4 buttons to press.
    - In defend phase, A 4 button sequence must be pressed within 1.2
    seconds in order to halve damage done. Note that partially finishing
    the sequence counts.
    final_damage = damage - damage / (2 / (successes / 4))
    (note divide by zero with integers throws an exception so there
    should be a check to simply return damage if successes == 0)
    If the 4 button sequence has been pressed successfully, the player
    has a chance to complete a 7 button sequence in 1.5 seconds.
    If successful, negates damage by 3/4 and makes the next attack
    a critical hit (2x multiplier), but skips the recovery phase.
    The player can actually die if the 3/4 damage does lethal damage
    and will not be able to progress because the recovery phase was
    skipped.
    No change if fail.
    - Recovery phase is skipped unless the player has received a lethal
    blow. This is a chance to recover but can only be done 3 times total.
    If the player receives a lethal blow and progresses to the recovery
    phase for the fourth time in a battle, the player cannot recover.
    The player must input a sequence of 6 buttons within 1.5 seconds.
    A successfully pressed sequence will recover the player to half of
    their maxHP.
    - When battle ends, if the player succeeds, hp will reset to max hp.
    if the player loses, it's game over maannnnn.
